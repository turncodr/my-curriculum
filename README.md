# my-curriculum
A cloud-native application to manage the curriculum and syllabi handbooks of degree programs. The Application was programed using Java (SpringBoot, Maven), Bootstrap and GitHub to organize and oversee all the changes made to the project.

The prerequisite to work on this project is to install JDK 8 (or later) on your system, though we are working on an update to JDK 11.

Next install the project building tool Maven (https://maven.apache.org/install.html).

The third program you'll need to participate is the version control tool git.

If you don't have a GitHub-Account yet, create one [here](https://github.com/) and fork this repository.

Clone the repository via `git clone https://github.com/<yourgithubname>/my-curriculum.git`

Add the remote repository *upstream* via `git remote add upstream https://github.com/turncodr/my-curriculum.git`
